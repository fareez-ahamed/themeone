                "O People, lend me an attentive ear, for I know not whether, after this year, I shall ever be amongst
                you again.
                Therefore listen to what I am saying to you very carefully and take these words to those who could not
                be present here today"

            <p class="my-4">
                O People, just as you regard this month, this day, this city as sacred, so regard the property of
                every muslim as a sacred trust. Return the goods entrusted to you to their rightful owners. Hurt 
                no one so that no one may hurt you. Remember that you will indeed meet your Lord, and that He will
                indeed reckon your deeds. Allah has forbidden you to take usury (Interest), therefore all interest
                obligation shall henceforth be waived. Your capital, however, is yours to keep. You will neither
                inflict nor suffer inequity. Allah has judged that there shall be no interest and that all the 
                interest due to Abbas ibn' Abd'al Muttalib shall henceforth be waived.
            </p>

                Beware of Satan, for the safety of your religion. He has lost all hope that he will ever be able to
                lead you astray in big things, so beware of following him in small things.
            </p>
            <p class="my-4">
                O People it is true that you have certain rights with regard to your women, but they also have rights
                over you. Remember that you have taken them as your wives only under Allah's trust and with His
                permission. If they abide by your right then to them belongs the right to be fed and clothed in kindness.
                Do treat your women well and be kind to them for they are your partners and committed helpers.
                As it is your right that they do not make friends with any one of whom you do not approve, as well
                as never to be unchaste.
            </p>
            <p class="my-4">
                O People, listen to me in earnest, worship Allah, say your five daily prayers (Salah), fast during
                the month of Ramadan, and give your wealth in Zakat. Perform Hajj if you can afford to.
            </p>

                All mankind is from Adam and Eve, an Arab has no superiority over a non Arab nor a non-Arab
                has any superiority over an Arab; also a white has no superiority over black nor a black has any
                superiority over white except by piety and good action. Learn that every Muslim is a brother to 
                every Muslim and that the Muslims constitute one brotherhood. Nothing shall be legitimate to a Muslim
                which belongs to a fellow Muslim unless it was given freely and willingly. Do not, therefore, do
                injustice to yourselves.
            </p>
            <p class="my-4">
                Remember, one day you will appear before Allah and answer for your deeds. So beware, do not
                stray from the path of righteousness after I am gone.
            </p>

                O People, No Prophet or Apostle will come after me and no new faith will be born. Reason well,
                therefore, O People, and understand words which I convey to you. I leave behind me two things,
                the Quran and my example, the Sunnah and if you follow these you will never go astray.
